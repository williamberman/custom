Initial installation

For a flask application

Virtual hosts should have permission 755 on all folders and all files should have read permission for the serving user
Add 755 for all folders
`find <site root> -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;`

Use a2ensite and a2dissite to enable and disable applications respectively

Install mod_wsgi for python applications
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/mod_wsgi/

wsgi does not support multiple different python interpreters as the interpreter itself is embedded in the shared object.
The solution is to pip install mod_wsgi and to then use the script mod_wsgi-express.

Because this pip install does some compilation on the system, it requires the apache extension tool and the python headers.
Which are in apache2-dev and python<version>-dev on ubuntu.

The apache extension tool is part of the dev package which is apache2-dev on ubuntu
